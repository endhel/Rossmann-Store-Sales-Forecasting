# 1. Problem

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

After a meeting between Rossmann's directors, managers and CEO, it was planned that the stores should be renovated. However, in order to raise funds for the renovation, it was necessary to forecast sales more accurately, so the business team decided to **forecast the sales for the next 6 weeks of the stores, in order to know if the budget will be enough for the renovation.**

# 2. Solution Proposal
